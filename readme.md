= Use your glance or fingerprint using Touch ID or Face ID for easy and secure access. =

Improve your authentication security; you do not need a password.
When you enable Passwordless WP on your site, you can log in with a simple action.

The Web Authentication API (also known as WebAuthn) is a specification written by the W3C and FIDO, with the participation of Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, Yubico, and others. The API allows servers to register and authenticate users using public-key cryptography instead of a password.

WebAuthn was officially recognized as a W3C web standard in March 2019. Web Authentication is a new standard enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users using hardware authenticators.

= GDPR Safe =

The web standard was created from the outset with a “privacy by design” approach and are a strong fit for GDPR compliance. Crucially, the plugin delivers authentication with no third-party involvement or tracking between accounts. And when it comes to biometrics, FIDO and WebAuthn standards prevent this information from being stored and matched in servers – it never leaves the user’s device do not allow for any biometric data to be captured.
